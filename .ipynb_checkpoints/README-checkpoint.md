# Blockchain Contract Descriptions

## RealEstateToken Contract

This contract is like creating your own digital currency for real estate purposes. Imagine you have a digital token, like a special kind of online coin, that represents ownership or value in real estate. The person who creates this contract (deploys it on the blockchain) is given special powers to create ("mint") new tokens. These tokens can then be given to other people, representing some value or ownership in real estate.

## RentalAgreement Contract

Think of this contract as a digital version of a housing rental agreement. It's like an online contract between a landlord and a tenant. The contract records details like how much rent the tenant needs to pay, when the lease starts and ends, and the security deposit amount. It also allows the tenant to pay their rent digitally through this contract. The contract makes sure that only the tenant can pay the rent and only during the agreed lease period.

## Crowdfunding Contract

This contract is like an online fundraising platform. It's used to collect money from different people for a specific goal or project. People can send money to this contract as their contribution to the funding goal. The contract keeps track of how much everyone has contributed. Once the total amount of money contributed reaches the goal, the contract stops accepting more money. The person who created the contract can then take out the money, but only after the funding goal is reached.
